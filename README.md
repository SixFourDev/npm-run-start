### Welcome Page

The Welcome Page will feature some popular different shoes that we have to offer! It will be presented in the middle of the page that will have the name of the shoe, and the price. There are also two buttons, the "View Shoe" button that will bring you to a detailed page of the shoe, and the "Add to Cart" button that will add that given shoe to your cart. To make browsing even more enjoyable, we've included a user-friendly carousel that lets you effortlessly navigate through popular shoes. Simply glide from side to side, clicking the arrows to explore each design.
